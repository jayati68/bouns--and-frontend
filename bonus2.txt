How to Make Your Webpage a PWA?
A PWA (Progressive Web App) is basically a website that feels like an app—it loads fast, works offline, and can even send notifications. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Add a Web App Manifest (Makes It Installable)
Think of this as a profile card for your website. It tells the browser:

What name to show when users install the app
What icon to use
What colors to apply
What URL to open when launched

Create a manifest.json file:

{
  "name": "My E-Commerce Store",
  "short_name": "Shop",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#007bff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

 Link it in your index.html file so the browser knows about it:

<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
	
2. Add a Service Worker (Handles Offline Mode)
A service worker is a script that runs in the background and caches your website files so that it works even when the internet is down.

 Create a service-worker.js file:

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
    event.waitUntil(
        caches.open('static-cache').then(cache => {
            return cache.addAll([
                '/',
                '/index.html',
                '/styles.css',
                '/script.js',
                '/images/banner.jpg'
            ]);
        })
    );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
            return response || fetch(event.request);
        })
    );
});
	

This does two things:

Caches important files (like homepage, CSS, JS, images) so they load instantly.
Serves cached files when offline, so your store still works even if the user loses internet!
 Now, register the service worker in your script.js file:

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
        .then(() => console.log('Service Worker Registered!'))
        .catch(error => console.log('Service Worker Failed:', error));
}

3. Enable “Add to Home Screen” Button
Now that your site is a PWA, let’s make it easy for users to install it like an app on their phone.

 In your script.js file, add this:

let installPrompt;

window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    installPrompt = event;
    document.getElementById('install-btn').style.display = 'block';
});

document.getElementById('install-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    installPrompt.prompt();
});

In index.html, add this button:

<button id="install-btn" style="display:none;">Install App</button>

4. Add Push Notifications (Optional, But Awesome!)
Want to send notifications about sales or new arrivals? You can use Push API + Firebase.
(We won’t dive deep here, but it’s a great way to engage customers!)

 Why This Is Cool?
 Works Offline – Users can browse products even without the internet. Loads Faster – The site is cached, so it opens instantly.
 Installable – Feels like a real app, no need for the Play Store.
 Push Notifications – Can remind users about sales or abandoned carts.
